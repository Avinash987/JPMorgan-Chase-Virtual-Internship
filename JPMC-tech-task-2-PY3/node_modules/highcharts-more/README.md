# highcharts-more
This is just a highcharts-more module copied from highcharts v0.1.7.
This package is generated for simplicity of use.

# Installation
```bash
npm install highcharts-more --save
```
# Usage
The package expects that global `Highcharts` variable is set.
It also doesn't export anything.

Then just require the package if you use common.js
```javascript
require('highcharts-more')
```

Or include the script in your HTML file.
```html
<script src = "node_modules/highcharts-more/index.js">
```
